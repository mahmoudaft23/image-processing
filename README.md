# 🖼️ Digital Image Processing GUI

A simple **Python GUI application** built with **Tkinter** that allows you to load images, apply different image processing filters (segmentation, edge detection, thresholding, Laplacian, custom filters, etc.), and save the results.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Open image from file explorer  
✅ Convert to grayscale  
✅ Apply various filters:
- Point Detection  
- Horizontal Line Detection  
- Vertical Line Detection  
- +45° Line Detection  
- -45° Line Detection  
- Edge Detection (vertical, horizontal, ±45°)  
- Laplacian  
- Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)  
- Custom filters (user-defined kernel)  
- Thresholding  

✅ Save processed images as `.jpg`  
✅ Welcome window with filter overview  
✅ GUI built using **Tkinter**
